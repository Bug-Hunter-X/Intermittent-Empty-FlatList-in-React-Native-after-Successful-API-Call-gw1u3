# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A React Native application fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint.  A FlatList component is used to display the fetched data. Occasionally, despite a successful API call and the data being correctly stored in the component's state, the FlatList remains empty.  This behavior is inconsistent and difficult to pinpoint.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data being passed to the FlatList is what you expect and handling potential issues with asynchronous operations more robustly.  The solution provided handles error cases and adds logging to help identify any potential issues. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app on a React Native environment.
3. Observe that the FlatList will sometimes render empty, even after showing loading and then resolving to the correct data.
